# HBOT - Main Project

HBOT is a humanoid robot driven by RC servos.

Its design is derived from [Robonoid](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/humanoid-robot-robonoid-design-concept), which is derived from [Plen2](https://github.com/plenprojectcompany/PLEN2).

This design makes use of ES08MA II servos controlled by a custom STM32F4/ESP8266 based electronics.

The STL file of each Robonoid's part is available for download on pinshape.com. These files are licensed under CC - Attribution - Non-Commercial - No Derivatives. Download is not free, each single part must be purchased.

I wrote to the copyright owner to clarify why single parts have a different license that the main concept and what do it mean to prevent derivative work on single parts when this restriction does not apply on the whole concept. I never got any answer.

It seems clear that these parts can be purchased, downloaded, printed and used in an assembly. They can also be shared under CC - Attribution - Non-Commercial - No Derivatives. They cannot be modified to generate derivative parts but can be redesigned as a derivative work of the main concept.

These parts are available in this repo but if you want to support the Robonoid project, please consider purchasing them on pinshape.com.
